R1060RBTFRFE48,Yes,Swing 1,Baby Product,1 Star,i purchased one of these swings for my last child. it was around the same priceÃÂ this one the seat is terrible. it wakes my baby up when heÃÂs in it and iÃÂm sure itÃÂs because itÃÂs so uncomfortable. there is no head support and it dips so far in he either crunches up in it or his head is way back. the swing also squeaks and makes noise swinging. the mobile it comes with doesnÃÂt move. the speaker for the sound is absolutely terrible. i would highly recommend going with a different one! again i purchased one from the same brand for my last child a couple years ago and it was around the same price but much better!,All bad,noise,"seat, swing, speaker",,seat,Unsatisfactory (Neg)
R13DJ77EZFAIWI,Yes,Seat & Bouncer 1,Baby Product,1 Star,"i ho ly feel bad i asked for his and family paid so much for it. i'm not even using it anymore.
we had to prop the stand as the bars had to be bent just to assemble which made the swing base uneven. the entire swing rocked with the base leaving the floor.
it also reclines in an odd way but doesn't allow the baby to sit up when he gets older like it appears in the photos.
swing mechanism is also very loud.
i'd return it if i could.",NOT SAFE,uneven,"swing base, swing",bent,,Unsatisfactory (Neg)
R15NYSUD9N39B7,No,Car Seat 1,Baby Product,4 Star,this brand car seat 12 swivel convertible car seat is incredible! not only does it grow with your baby to fit all your safety needs for years to come but it was easy to install. it is a heavier car seat on the market but for the added convenience of rotating i take it as a win. the only negatives i seem to have run across is that it moves a bit more than the infant car seat side to side and although it can be machine washed it must be air dried per the instruction manual. already recommending this to all the other families with little ones.,Will be buying this for future babies!,,seat,,seat,Neutral

R2ZU3HIE2RLBFT,Yes,Travel System 1,Baby Product,2 Star,okay so here is the deal with this car seat and strollerÃÂ. the stroller is niceÃÂ a bit bulky ho ly but pretty cuteÃÂ. i like the fact it grows with your child as well and the pram. listen i would buy the stroller separately and not together. the car seat is a cheap hunk of junk!!!!! there is absolutely zero infant head support and the entire time i used this car seat for the month i did before replacing for a more expensive better quality one i had to hold my babies hold up. i showed this image to a childrenÃÂs hospital emergency room pediatrician and she immediately said i needed a new car seat and that the position of my babies neck in the car seat would cause long term damage over time. this car seat needs to be recalled. it also is a pain in the butt because you have to put the straps through the back of the car seat and weave them through to adjust. the padding is non existent. itÃÂs practically impossible getting them out of the car seat. the padding on the top always falls off. the car seat is a complete and utter nightmare. i do recommend the stroller not the car seat !!!!!,Good quality stroller TERRIBLE CAR SEAT,bulky,"seat, strap, pad, stroller",,"seat, pad, stroller, strap",Poor Design & Quality (Neg)

R3H1BEBNHTF5I,No,Travel System 1,Baby Product,4 Star,"when my husband and i first bought this stroller system it took us awhile to figure out how it folds and all goes together. just don't complicate things and it's very simple. it rides very smoothly surprisingly and i love that the carseat clicks right in. also love the pramette mode so baby can lay down and nap during walks. it took us awhile to realize that while in pramette mode you can recline the stroller a little bit more up. lol our baby was more head down before we realized and it was a bit awkward. the bin under the stroller is big enough to fit our diaper backpack fully packed and some groceries. it drives through grass, mud, etc. it's not too heavy and fits in my cars trunk (2013 impala). the carseat is nice as well. i'm going to be sad when he outgrows it because it's so convenient to just click him in and out of the car. i do wish the carseat had a better infant insert for the babies head. when baby is a newborn and in carseat their neck cranks a little more (like fully to the side because there is nothing to support it *the insert in it is not very supportive) and i didn't want to buy one not made for the seat due to safety concerns.",A very good purchase,,"seat, stroller",,"seat, stroller",Satisfactory & Recommended (Pos)

i love this stroller set itÃÂs beautiful. the material is great. i love that it came with the car seat, stroller, car seat bace , and the toddler seat.
i love how tall it is iÃÂm 5ÃÂ7 and itÃÂs perfect height. i also loveeee that you can slide the car seat and toddler seat up closer to you or down away from you. the basket is big i love that no struggling to get ur bag in and out. also the basket is devoid into 2 i big spot and a smaller spot. moves great iÃÂve have no problems with the wheels or locks. the front wheels have locks . maybe for runs or jogs. over all this is a really great stroller set. it rides smoothly.

(cons)
the stroller is bulky so if you want something small compact or to fit in a small car this would not work. it dose have a large basket so the frame is bulky. also the back wheels are larger.
also this is described as a 3 in 1 and shows you the car seat, toddler seat and bassinet. but unfortunately the bassinet did not come with it and itÃÂs an extra $170 and it was written in very small letters on one of the tags. they made it look like it came with all. itÃÂs heavy to carry

R3SO15OMHZZZ7Z,Yes,Travel System 1,Baby Product,1 Star,"i did a lot of research to choose the travel system i wanted for our newborn considering how expensive they are. i am extremely disappointed with this one. first off, folding it down is a total pain. it doesn't stay upright at all and topples over every time i collapse it. it is not even close to being compact, especially with the seat attached. you'll have to have a decent sized trunk to fit it in. the first time we opened it, it took 5 people to figure out you have to release the clasp all the way on the bottom. does not make it easy at all to unfold. the bassinet/seat insert does not feel secure at all. when you lay the baby in the way they're supposed to face the seat tilts back to where their head is hanging down. no where could i find to fix this tilt. it feels loose and unsafe. the car seat itself is fine enough, the click in base is easy to use. do not recommend this stroller at all though. i highly suggest looking elsewhere.",Not As Great As I Expected,unsafe,"seat, stroller",loose,"seat, stroller, bassinet",Unsatisfactory (Neg)

REI1C69MJ1P67,No,Car Seat 1,Baby Product,5 Star,"i waited for months to order this car seat, and was so excited when it came in the mail, but ended up disappointed. the concept of being able to rotate the car seat amazed me, and itÃÂs the only reason why i am giving this product a two star review. i love that it makes it incredibly easier to get my child in and out of the car. itÃÂs very convenient, and definitely a game changer for this task.
however the quality of this product made me wish i had just stuck with a different brand instead. this is my first time purchasing a brand car seat, i switched from a chico and paid around the same price, but the difference in quality is too big not to notice.
the materials feel very cheap, and the make of the seat itself is not that great. the seatbelt clips wiggle. the insert padding is very poor quality. the cupholders are very flimsy and come apart easily, my 10 month old baby was able to remove them with no problem. the seat itself does not rotate 360 degrees, not sure if itÃÂs only my car, but it only does a 180 turn.
when you are paying over $400 for a car seat itÃÂs just unacceptable to neglect selling a high quality product.
