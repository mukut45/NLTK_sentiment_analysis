R1060RBTFRFE48,Yes,Swing 1,Baby Product,1 Star,I purchased one of these swings for my last child. It was around the same price… this one the seat is terrible. It wakes my baby up when he’s in it and I’m sure it’s because it’s so uncomfortable. There is no head support and it dips so far in he either crunches up in it or his head is way back. The swing also squeaks and makes noise swinging. The mobile it comes with doesn’t move. The speaker for the sound is absolutely terrible. I would highly recommend going with a different one! Again I purchased one from the same brand for my last child a couple years ago and it was around the same price but much better!,All bad
R13DJ77EZFAIWI,Yes,Seat & Bouncer 1,Baby Product,1 Star,"I ho ly feel bad I asked for his and family paid so much for it. I'm not even using it anymore.
We had to prop the stand as the bars had to be bent just to assemble which made the swing base uneven. The entire swing rocked with the base leaving the floor.
It also reclines in an odd way but doesn't allow the baby to sit up when he gets older like it appears in the photos.
Swing mechanism is also very loud.
I'd return it if I could.",NOT SAFE
R15NYSUD9N39B7,No,Car Seat 1,Baby Product,4 Star,This Brand Car Seat 12 swivel convertible car seat is incredible! Not only does it grow with your baby to fit all your safety needs for years to come but it was easy to install. It is a heavier car seat on the market but for the added convenience of rotating I take it as a win. The only negatives I seem to have run across is that it moves a bit more than the infant car seat side to side and although it can be machine washed it must be air dried per the instruction manual. Already recommending this to all the other families with little ones.,Will be buying this for future babies!
R15UXWMELB3VVP,Yes,Swing 1,Baby Product,1 Star,"seat bucket is angled too deep causing baby's head to tuck against the chest, causing discomfort. the seat belts are useless and aggravating to newborn.",The seat bucket is angled incorrectly
R168A29OOS1W0B,Yes,Car Seat 1,Baby Product,2 Star,"Installing is pretty easy, the locking mechanism helps a lot with securing you don’t have to pull like crazy because of this system. Pretty good colors and cushions. 5 point harness is a bit flimsy. Minor details aside only disappointment is the rotation axis, if your car has bolstered rear seats, chances are high that the car seat will rub the bolsters and won’t rotate easily. Removing cup holders helps a tiny bit but then without the cup holders there are pointy plastic things sticking out. If your rear seats have flat surface you won’t notice this. They should mention this in the description/manual.",Does not rotate easily if car has bolstered rear seats
R1A4KLB4ZCZSTT,Yes,Travel System 1,Baby Product,1 Star,Received this as a baby shower gift this year. Had 6 week old in her car seat in the stroller. Pushed the brake down and the brakes did not work! Extremely dangerous situation that ended in police and paramedics to be involved. Even with both brakes down stroller still moves by slightest movement.,Dangerous! Brakes did not work
R1CELHXQRKVJF2,Yes,Travel System 1,Baby Product,1 Star,"I bought this stroller hoping it would serve all three purpose of car seat, pramette and stroller. While the other two are good, but the stroller is very inconvenient. Its wheels go way ward and it cannot be controlled with one hand at all. Even with both hands it takes your full energy to keep it moving in intended direction and it exhausta you after a while.

Car seat is comfortable and good but the tightening belt is short and I had to buy another belt to use it properly in my Subaru Forester, otherwise it was not fitting in the designed intended location.",Very uncomfortable manuevre and Unaligned movement of wheels
R1DIVNPAIGHPHF,Yes,Car Seat 1,Baby Product,2 Star,"Displeased with this car seat.
- slides/moves on seat even when rightly anchored
- Noisy! When the child is not in the seat it rattles and makes a lot of noise which is very distracting even audible when radio is on.
- The rotating seat does not lock tightly and will move slightly when the child is in the seat and can make noise.
- the belt buckle inserts always slide all the way down and you have to fish for them underneath the child to get them and buckled
- the chest buckle is cheap",Greco swing
R20LGOTJ0NTTGD,Yes,Stroller 1,Baby Product,1 Star,"Over the stroller is ok.... The CHILD'S TRAY was hard to attach. Hence I broke it. Contached support said it was out of stock. (this was in November) . I called on December 21st to see if they has it back in stock. Answer was no, estimated January 21, 2024, it has to come from china. Maybe we will get the tray before the child grows out of it.",Product support
R2D0R8NU0JRPRV,Yes,Swing 1,Baby Product,2 Star,"The swing is nice but it’s way too big for a new born, it seems like it will fit 4+ months, also I can’t seem to get the vibration to work. And the set up for the wiring was a bit complicated",Too wide for a newborn
R2PSNKR9CE05EO,Yes,Swing 1,Baby Product,2 Star,"It’s huge, the seat is too scooped and causes baby to spit up, the swing goes extremely fast even on lowest setting and causes spit up…the mobile doesn’t move. The instructions were not great and the vibration requires batteries but it doesn’t tell you… so you already put it together and it’s too hard to add after the fact… there are way too many straps so by the time you get sleepy baby situated, they wake up from all the movement to get them strapped in. The songs are way too quiet and unclear. I went with this one because it is a name brand and the last swing I had collapsed so I don’t trust it again.",Not a great design
R2ZU3HIE2RLBFT,Yes,Travel System 1,Baby Product,2 Star,Okay so here is the deal with this car seat and stroller…. The stroller is nice… a bit bulky ho ly but pretty cute…. I like the fact it grows with your child as well and the pram. Listen I would buy the stroller separately and not together. The car seat is a cheap hunk of junk!!!!! There is absolutely zero infant head support and the entire time I used this car seat for the month I did before replacing for a more expensive better quality one I had to hold my babies hold up. I showed this image to a children’s hospital emergency room pediatrician and she immediately said I needed a new car seat and that the position of my babies neck in the car seat would cause long term damage over time. This car seat needs to be recalled. It also is a pain in the butt because you have to put the straps through the back of the car seat and weave them through to adjust. The padding is non existent. It’s practically impossible getting them out of the car seat. The padding on the top always falls off. The car seat is a complete and utter nightmare. I DO RECOMMEND THE STROLLER NOT THE CAR SEAT !!!!!,Good quality stroller TERRIBLE CAR SEAT
R30BJJ7ZND31ZT,No,Car Seat 1,Baby Product,3 Star,"There is a safety issue with the seatbelt install method when rear facing. It will start off tight and loosen over time to where my child was diagonal after a slow turn. Went from little to no movement at belt path and gradually increased to 4"" or more movement at belt path. Brand confirmed my install was correct and sent replacement seat. Happened again with replacement. This time when I called back they confirmed it's a KNOWN safety issue with the seatbelt install method and you can only safely use the latch method to install RF. This means the seat maxes out at 35 lbs when rear facing. My child was 34.5 lbs and the seat doesn't swivel in the FF orientation. I switched to a different brand's rotating seat and it feels 100% more secure.",SAFETY ISSUE
R30SDDTG2FDEVR,No,Swing 1,Baby Product,3 Star,"I love that my grand baby loves this swing. It lulls her to sleep and satisfies her even when she’s not sleepy. But, the vibration never worked and the seat cover is too small for the frame. I got all but one of the snaps to snap but it was a struggle. The music and volume buttons don’t always work and when they do, you can barely hear it. The swing works ok but I would not use it past speed one because it swings dangerously if past one. I waited too late to return so I use it.

Update number one: I did end up ordering another one to see if I will have the same issues. Will post update number two soon.",Good for lulling to sleep
R332PDLU3QAKMT,Yes,Swing 1,Baby Product,1 Star,The padding for the swing tears at the seams. I’m shocked no on has filed a class action lawsuit against them for a baby choking on the stuffing yet.,Garbage. Save your money and don’t buy it!
R3EOB0HZYTA7ZA,No,Seat & Bouncer 1,Baby Product,3 Star,Great idea. 2 in 1 swing and vibrating seat but could be better executed. Swing is one position only side to side and mobile on swing does not spin or has no lights just basic stars that hang and do not keep baby’s attention. Also pre set music is awful. I believe it’s the nutcracker or nightmare before Christmas tune. Not so soothing once baby is asleep. Mom of 5 and this is my least favorite swing I have owned. I wanted to love it due to not having to have two separate baby gear items but it just doesn’t compare to other swings I have had.,Semi functional
R3H1BEBNHTF5I,No,Travel System 1,Baby Product,4 Star,"When my husband and I first bought this stroller system it took us awhile to figure out how it folds and all goes together. Just don't complicate things and it's very simple. It rides very smoothly surprisingly and I love that the carseat clicks right in. Also love the pramette mode so baby can lay down and nap during walks. It took us awhile to realize that while in pramette mode you can recline the stroller a little bit more up. Lol our baby was more head down before we realized and it was a bit awkward. The bin under the stroller is big enough to fit our diaper backpack fully packed and some groceries. It drives through grass, mud, etc. It's not too heavy and fits in my cars trunk (2013 Impala). The carseat is nice as well. I'm going to be sad when he outgrows it because it's so convenient to just click him in and out of the car. I do wish the carseat had a better infant insert for the babies head. When baby is a newborn and in carseat their neck cranks a little more (like fully to the side because there is nothing to support it *the insert in it is not very supportive) and I didn't want to buy one not made for the seat due to safety concerns.",A very good purchase
R3KSTP361P3YAM,Yes,Stroller 1,Baby Product,1 Star,"We've had various Brand seats and strollers for both kids, but I don’t cate for this carseat. My baby was nearly 9lbs when we left the hospital and has already grown out of the seat after 3 weeks. The straps do not line up with the padding slips and they lay nearly flat to the seat even on the longest setting. If they were adjustable like the toddler carseat, we could get more than a few weeks out them. In my case, this was a waste of money. I think this carseat is more suitable for preemies, but it should still have a few adjustable options.",Good to start
R3O0AMYOEPU6UV,Yes,Seat & Bouncer 1,Baby Product,1 Star,"I had put this on my registry & a family member kindly bought it. From the pictures online, it looks more a light gray, but it's white. My biggest issue was the seat legs were so warped that it would've been dangerous to put my baby in it. Unfortunately, had to return.",Not impressed
R3OWB9JXOS923C,Yes,Travel System 2,Baby Product,1 Star,I suggest you look elsewhere! We thought we were being frugal with options for growth but this has not lasted 7 months. The wheels are like pushing a bad shopping cart and durability has been poor. It’s large and and the large turning radius is not easy to maneuver in restaurants. The carseat gets jammed and stuck in the base and the stroller while carrying it. We suggest spending money on better quality. It has not lasted us 7 months and we are seeking a refund.,Do not buy
R3S6ZXUE4XCBB1,No,Travel System 1,Baby Product,5 Star,"(PROS)
I love this stroller set it’s beautiful. The material is great. I love that it came with the car seat, stroller, car seat bace , and the toddler seat.
I love how tall it is I’m 5’7 and it’s perfect height. I also loveeee that you can slide the car seat and toddler seat up closer to you or down away from you. The basket is big I love that no struggling to get ur bag in and out. Also the basket is devoid into 2 i big spot and a smaller spot. Moves great I’ve have no problems with the wheels or locks. The front wheels have locks . Maybe for runs or jogs. Over all this is a really great stroller set. It rides smoothly.

(Cons)
The stroller is bulky so if you want something small compact or to fit in a small car this would not work. It dose have a large basket so the frame is bulky. Also the back wheels are larger.
Also this is desCribed as a 3 in 1 and shows you the car seat, toddler seat and bassinet. BUT unfortunately the bassinet did not come with it and it’s an extra $170 and it was written in very small letters on one of the tags. They made it look like it came with all. It’s heavy to carry

I personally love how big this stroller is??????

I have a 2014 ford edge sport and it fits perfectly in my truck and I still have space.",Obsessed ??
R3SO15OMHZZZ7Z,Yes,Travel System 1,Baby Product,1 Star,"I did a lot of research to choose the travel system I wanted for our newborn considering how expensive they are. I am extremely disappointed with this one. First off, folding it down is a total pain. It doesn't stay upright at all and topples over every time I collapse it. It is not even close to being compact, especially with the seat attached. You'll have to have a decent sized trunk to fit it in. The first time we opened it, it took 5 people to figure out you have to release the clasp all the way on the bottom. Does not make it easy at all to unfold. The bassinet/seat insert does not feel secure at all. When you lay the baby in the way they're supposed to face the seat tilts back to where their head is hanging down. No where could I find to fix this tilt. It feels loose and unsafe. The car seat itself is fine enough, the click in base is easy to use. Do not recommend this stroller at all though. I highly suggest looking elsewhere.",Not As Great As I Expected
R3VIOHME68S2R9,Yes,Swing 1,Baby Product,1 Star,"Easy to assemble, standard features, toys are hanging too low. Good swing but ours smelled like chemicals/plastic and the little motor was too loud.",Not perfect for every child
R577CB4I8OVS8,Yes,Swing 1,Baby Product,2 Star,"Our old swing broke (it was a hand me down) so my husband quickly went to get a replacement as our last swing was a lifesaver. This swing has a cute fabric but I am super disappointed in the mobile. It's cheaply made, doesn't spin or do anything exciting. Their are giant tags on the stars that make it look unaesthetically pleasing (i understand they have to do this for reasons). My son no longer likes going in a swing. It's our fault for not doing more research, but for anyone who is, I would recommend to look elsewhere. Find a swing with a mobile that works and will entertain your little:) I would have returned but life with 2 Littles, a job, and a husband who works all the time doesn't make packaging up a giant item and returning it easy.",Mobile is pointless
R876YPS6H756U,No,Car Seat 1,Baby Product,3 Star,"The rotation feature is phenomenal! Has made my life so much easier. The install is fairly straight forward.. but I had a hard time getting the straps tight enough. The cup holders don’t stay on..
But overall so worth the money! And super comfy for my little girl",Love the rotation feature
RAQ0OCWEW073S,Yes,Seat & Bouncer 1,Baby Product,1 Star,"This took so long to assemble, and once assembled I realized it’s defective, the seat is so high up, waste of my time , I’m 9 months pregnant and this stressed me out .",Defective
REI1C69MJ1P67,No,Car Seat 1,Baby Product,5 Star,"I waited for months to order this car seat, and was so excited when it came in the mail, but ended up disappointed. The concept of being able to rotate the car seat amazed me, and it’s the only reason why I am giving this product a two star review. I love that it makes it incredibly easier to get my child in and out of the car. It’s very convenient, and definitely a game changer for this task.
However the quality of this product made me wish I had just stuck with a different brand instead. This is my first time purchasing a Brand car seat, I switched from a Chico and paid around the same price, but the difference in quality is too big not to notice.
The materials feel very cheap, and the make of the seat itself is not that great. The seatbelt clips wiggle. The insert padding is very poor quality. The cupholders are very flimsy and come apart easily, my 10 month old baby was able to remove them with no problem. The seat itself does not rotate 360 degrees, not sure if it’s only my car, but it only does a 180 turn.
When you are paying over $400 for a car seat it’s just unacceptable to neglect selling a high quality product.
If you are interested in purchasing this car seat, my only advice is that you prioritize what matters most to you, whether is convenience or a high quality product.",Convenient swivel feature
REQXBU1R70WZE,Yes,Swing 1,Baby Product,1 Star,"The swing is okay, it does the job I guess. there's things I definitely dislike and wish I would have chosen a different one. Firstly, the little buttons you push in to put the whole thing together are an absolute joke and very cheap. My 1½ year old can push them in with ease and then the whole frame falls apart. Talk about dangerous.. secondly the seat isn't adjustable what so ever, so it only swings side to side and cannot be reclined or sat up more. Thirdly, the mobile doesn't move or spin so really it's pointless imo, And lastly I'm pretty sure the swing only goes one speed no matter what setting it's on. It's really a pretty basic, cheap swing. Would of expected more for the price and better quality from Brand. Disappointed.",It's disappointing..
RGZUZC0VKPVLO,Yes,Swing 1,Baby Product,1 Star,"Expensive gift, and the recipient just informed me that the gift no longer works. I'm pretty disappointed in the quality and can't even exchange it..Wtf
Don't buy this",Used 3 months and the swing and vibration wont work anymore
RHK1537HVWITT,No,Swing 1,Baby Product,3 Star,"Rocker can be like a metronome with the noise. But I would like the rocking levels to start lower. The first level seems a bit extreme and would prefer it to be a little of a teeter to both directions. Our baby loves it but we try not to abuse it. The straps seems a little flimsy so we always have someone in the room to avoid any issues with SIDS.

The music and the background noise is a nice touch. Vibration is pretty extreme too so it would have been nice if it was a tad softer for the lower setting.",Works but has flaws
